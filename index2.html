            <p>This is in continuation with the previous part of the same episode. Lovanshi continued to shed light on issues of great importance in today's world. We start with LGBTQ+ community following with Women Empowerment then sliding into the topic of Climate Change after which we settle at Mental Health. These issues which are of such significance in the contemporary world are thoroughly explained by the guest in a very simplistic and cool manner. I say cool because teenagers tend to adapt things which they seem are cool and thus it hints that we need to make it cool to discuss these topics among our families and friends.</p>
